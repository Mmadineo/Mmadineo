<h1 class="page-title">ABOUT US</h1>
<p> Law firms and the department of justice utilize these tools as a database cloud storage and application for past, ongoing, and future cases and clients. This can include document assembly for relevant case details, notes on the opposition when applicable, time tracking, and any other case-related information. According to our research there is no application that is similar to the one we intending to build and implement. Most of the attorneys use the internet to provide their names, location and contact details to their target market and clients but need an application that will help them store their clients files and easily retrieve them at a later stage, especially during cases.

This case management system provides the means to manage court cases, court documents, evidences, case incidents and activities. Furthermore, this system provides tracking and management of the court calendar and automatic generation of reports.
