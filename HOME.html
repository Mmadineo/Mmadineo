<h1>WHAT IS LCMS<h1>
<p s>Legal case management software is a standardized tool for lawyers to oversee their practice. Law firms and the department of justice utilize these tools as a database for past, ongoing, and future cases and clients. This can include document assembly for relevant case details, notes on the opposition when applicable, time tracking, and any other case-related information. According to our research there is no application that is similar to the one we intending to build and implement. Most of the attorneys use the internet to provide their names, location and contact details to their target market and clients but need an application that will help them store their clients’ files and easily retrieve them at a later stage, especially during cases. Furthermore, they just use cloud-based systems to store their records but the information is not accessible during court sessions and is not available to the department of justice and judges during and after court sessions. </p>
